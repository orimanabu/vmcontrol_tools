Helper scripts for IBM Systems Director VMControl.

* libvirt_change_disk_devname.py
VMControl only supports device name such as '/dev/disk/by-id/wwn-XXX' as VM's target LUN.
The dev name is a symlink to /dev/sdX , therefor it is treated as "single path" device.
This script transforms the dev name to "multipath" device name like '/dev/disk/by-id/dm-uuid-YYY'.

Usage:
  ./libvirt_change_disk_devname.py [--wwn | --mpath] [--redefine | --dumpxml] VMNAME

--mpath: transform dev source in libvirt XML definition from 'wwn-XXX' to 'dm-uuid-YYY'.
--wwn:   transform dev source in libvirt XML definition from 'dm-uuid-YYY' to 'wwn-XXX'.

--dumpxml:  for debug. only show libvirt XML definition.
--redefine: do "virsh define".
